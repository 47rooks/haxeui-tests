# HaxeUI Tests

This repo contains a few HaxeUI and HaxeFlixel based tests. Mostly these are tested on HashLink but there isn't anything target specific in the code.

## value-and-error-renderer

This tests a renderer for a tableview that can render error information below the table cell that has the error. To cause the row data to be processed hit the Generate button after entering some data. To get example errors put the string "as" (without the quotes) into the f(x) column and hit Generate. Errors will clear as soon as new info is typed in the field.
